title: About

In short, I am a student living and studying in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I am quite fond of math, computers, and, above all, figuring out how they can be used to solve *actual* problems. I hope this site will act as a conduit to share my experiences and learnings.

It should be noted any 'technical' content that is posted in not peer-reviewed and as such should be, by default, taken as incorrect. Although I do try my best.
