> In short, I am a student living and studying in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I am quite fond math, computers, 	and above all, figuring out how they can be used to solve *actual* problems. I hope this site will act as a conduit to share my experiences and learnings.

If nothing else, just remember:

$$
\rho \frac{\mathrm{D}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{D}t} = -\nabla p + \nabla^2\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{g}
$$
